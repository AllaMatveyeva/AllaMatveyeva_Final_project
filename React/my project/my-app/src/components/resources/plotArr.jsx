            'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is a 2012 epic high
            fantasyadventure film directed by Peter Jackson. It is the first
            instalment in a three-part film adaptation based on J. R. R.
            Tolkienâ€™s 1937 novel The Hobbit. It is followed by The Desolation of
            Smaug (2013) and The Battle of the Five Armies (2014), and together,
            they act as a prequel to Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film
            trilogy. The film's screenplay was written by Jackson, his longtime
            collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, and Guillermo del
            Toro, who was originally chosen to direct the film before leaving
            the project in 2010.

            The story is set in Middle-earth sixty years before the main events
            of The Lord of the Rings, and portions of the film are adapted from
            the appendices to Tolkien's The Return of the King. An Unexpected
            Journey tells the tale of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is
            convinced by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to accompany thirteen
            Dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), on a quest to
            reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.
